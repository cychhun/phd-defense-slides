The questions were insightful, each answer revealing a new facet to the story we're building. Fabian's excitement was contagious, and Chloé's calm reassurance never faltered.\\\hspace*{10pt}My defense ended with thunderous applause and proud smiles, another step towards an exciting future where machines could understand stories on a deeper level.}}

\begin{enumerate}[<+(1)->]
    \item Why is this story so amazing? More generally, how can we evaluate the quality of a story?\\
    $\hookrightarrow$ \textbf{Methodology for Story Evaluation and Automatic Story Generation (ASG) Meta-Evaluation}
    \item How good are existing models at generating stories?\\
    $\hookrightarrow$ \textbf{HANNA: A Corpus of Human-ANnotated NArratives for ASG evaluation}
    \item Could we evaluate stories automatically?\\
    $\hookrightarrow$ \textbf{Meta-Evaluation Benchmark of Automatic Story Generation}
    \item What about large language models (LLMs)? Do they even understand the task of story evaluation?\\
    $\hookrightarrow$ \textbf{Exploring LLM Explainability for Automatic Story Evaluation (ASE) and ASG}
